                        <h3>My Journey</h3>
                        <p>Hey there! I'm Sphoorthi Malladad, a graduate student in Information Systems at Kelley School of Business - IUB. I'm passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems and bridge the gap between business needs and smart, scalable solutions. My interests lie at the intersection of data, systems design, and technology strategy - and I'm especially excited by work that blends analytical thinking with real impact.</p>
                        
                        <br>
                        
                        <h3>Outside the Classroom</h3>
                        <p>Outside the classroom and work, you'll probably find me chasing sunsets, curating my phone's 10,000th photo album, or hunting down the best dessert spot in town (life's too short to skip the last course!). Whether it's exploring a new city, capturing the perfect golden hour shot, or just unwinding with some good food and better company - I'm all about finding little joys along the way. Thanks for stopping by - feel free to check out my work or just say hi!</p>
